Description: Provides tools for simulating copy-number alteration (CNA) profiles, 
    applying a non-decimated Haar wavelet transform to genomic signals, and extracting 
    wavelet-derived features for use in supervised learning. Multiple machine learning 
    methods including Lasso and elastic-net regularisation, random forest, partial 
    least squares, neural networks and k-nearest neighbours are implemented to train 
    predictive models from genomic feature vectors. The workflow enables end-to-end 
    analysis from CNA simulation to feature extraction and classification.
