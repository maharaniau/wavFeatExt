Description: Provides tools for simulating copy-number alteration (CNA) profiles,
    applying a non-decimated Haar wavelet transform to genomic signals, and extracting
    wavelet-derived features for use in supervised learning. Multiple machine learning
    methods including lasso and elastic-net regularisation, random forest, partial
    least squares, neural networks and k-nearest neighbours are implemented to train
    predictive models from genomic feature vectors. The workflow enables end-to-end
    analysis from CNA simulation to feature extraction and classification.
