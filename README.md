This package contains utility functions to perform non-decimated Haar wavelet transformation and managing the extracted features for prediction. 
featureExtractRF will extract features from highly correlated genomic data, illustrated using Copy Number Alterations (CNA) data, using the 
non-decimated Haar wavelet transformation. The feature extraction step is performed before they are evaluated in 6 types of machine learning methods

#Instalation Once you have downloaded the TGUHm package, start R and enter: install.packages("~package directory/wavFeatExt_1.0.tar.gz",type="source", repos = NULL)
